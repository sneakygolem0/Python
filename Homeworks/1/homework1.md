## Problem 1: University Statistics

Write a program that contains the following list:
```python
universities = [
    ['California Institute of Technology', 2175, 37704],
    ['Harvard', 19627, 39849],
    ['Massachusetts Institute of Technology', 10566, 40732],
    ['Princeton', 7802, 37000],
    ['Rice', 5879, 35551],
    ['Stanford', 19535, 40569],
    ['Yale', 11701, 40500]
]
```

Define a function named `enrollment_stats()` that takes as an argument a list of lists, where each nested list has three elements: (a) the university name, (b) the total number of enrolled students, and (c) the annual tuition.

The `enrollment_stats()` function should return two lists: the first with all student counts as numbers, the second with all tuition amounts.

Define `mean()` and `median()` functions. Both should accept a list as an argument and return the mean and median of that list, respectively.

Using `universities`, `enrollment_stats()`, `mean()`, and `median()`, calculate:
- Total number of students
- Total tuition
- Mean and median of student counts
- Mean and median of tuition amounts

The output should be:
```
******************************
Total students: 77,285
Total tuition: $ 271,905
Student mean: 11,040.71
Student median: 10,566
Tuition mean: $ 38,843.57
Tuition median: $ 39,849
******************************
```

## Problem 2: Poetry Generator

Write a program that generates poems.

Create 5 lists for different types of words:

**Nouns:** `["fossil", "horse", "aardvark", "judge", "chef", "mango", "extrovert", "gorilla"]`

**Verbs:** `["kicks", "jingles", "bounces", "slurps", "meows", "explodes", "curdles"]`

**Adjectives:** `["furry", "balding", "incredulous", "fragrant", "exuberant", "glistening"]`

**Prepositions:** `["against", "after", "into", "beneath", "upon", "for", "in", "like", "over", "within"]`

**Adverbs:** `["curiously", "extravagantly", "tantalizingly", "furiously", "sensuously"]`

Randomly select the following number of elements from each list:
- 3 nouns
- 3 verbs
- 3 adjectives
- 2 prepositions
- 1 adverb

You can do this using the `choice()` function from the `random` module. This function takes a list as input and returns a randomly selected element from that list.

Example of how to use `random.choice()` to select a random element from the list `["a", "b", "c"]`:
```python
import random
random_element = random.choice(["a", "b", "c"])
```

Using the randomly selected words, create and display a poem with the following structure:
```
{A/An} {adj1} {noun1}
{A/An} {adj1} {noun1} {verb1} {prep1} the {adj2} {noun2}
{adverb1}, the {noun1} {verb2}
the {noun2} {verb3} {prep2} a {adj3} {noun3}
```

Here `adj` means adjective and `prep` means preposition.

Here is an example of a poem generated by your program:
```
A furry horse
A furry horse curdles within the fragrant mango
extravagantly, the horse slurps
the mango meows beneath a balding extrovert
```
